My initial project proposal is about crafting lectures in each domain in a way to get more attraction based on the TED Talk views. I will expand the domain of analysis beyond basic lecture characteristics (topic, duration, etc) and try to come up with more human-related criteria in order to educate people who want to lecture in more professional way.
TED Talk released some (12) basic variables about each talk on its platform. On top of this original dataset, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) created 111 additional variables that show more attributes of each talk. The LIWC analyzed the English transcript and produced variables that contain some emotional, non verbal information (confidence ,excitement, sadness, etc) that can impact audience attraction.
